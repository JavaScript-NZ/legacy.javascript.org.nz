		<p>The JavaScript Society of New Zealand is a non profit organisation set up to grow the JavaScript community within New Zealand. This includes running conferences and meet ups, and also providing help to those learning and using our favourite little programming language.</p>

		<p>We're active on the <a href="https://javascriptnewzealand.slack.com">JavaScript NZ Slack channel</a> and welcome you to come join the conversation. If you would like to support the society then you can <a href="/join">become a member</a> for a small yearly fee.</p>
